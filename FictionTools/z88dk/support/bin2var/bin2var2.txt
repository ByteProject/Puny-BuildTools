Bin2Var2

I have modified the program Bin2Var by David Phillips to make unsquished programs for the
TI-83 and TI-83 Plus.  It inserts the AsmPrgm symbol at the beginning of TI-83 Plus programs
and it inserts the End <enter> 0000 <enter> End stuff at the end of a TI-83 program.
I have also modified the squishing version to insert the tasmCmp symbol at the beginning of
TI-83 Plus programs so that they can be executed via Asm(prgmName) without a .db 0bbh, 6dh 
at the beginning of your program.  

Bin2var.exe squishes, Bin2var2.exe doesn't.  The syntax is the same for both.
Bin2var(2) input.bin output.ext
   valid output extensions are 82P 83P 8XP 85s 86p 86s, although I only modified 83P and 8XP
   The others still work exactly the same.

The batch files:
	ion.bat:  the original asm.bat, assembles for ION
	83asm.bat: makes an unsquished 83p file
	83pasm.bat: makes an unsquished 8xp file
	83squasm.bat: makes a squished 83p file
	83psqasm.bat: makes a squished 8xp file


The original documentation follows:


Bin2Var version 1.20

This is a simple utility that converts binary images into variables in
TI Graph Link format.  The following formats are supported: 82P, 83P,
8XP, 85S, 86P and 86S.  All testing was done using VTI and not the
actual TI Graph Link software.

This program was written as a suitable replacement for DevPac83 and
DevPac8X, as these programs do not work under Windows NT or Windows 2000.
Other formats may be supported in the future if there is a demand (i.e.
email me and tell me what you want!).  82P, 85S, 86P and 86S format were
added at Clem's request.

The included asm.bat batch file is a modification of the one included
with ION.  You can use it to compile TI-83 and TI-83+ programs for ION
using TASM.  Messages are written to stdout, so if you redirect the
program's to nul, no output will be printed under normal circumstances.
Error messages are written to stderr, so you will see errors even if
output is redirected to nul.

The program is written in ANSI C, so it should compile on just about any
platform.  There is a binary version include for Win32 (a console app) that
was compiled with Borland C++Builder 5.  I tested, it does compile on
Linux using GCC, but you'll have to compile it yourself if you want to
use it on Linux.

This program is released under the GNU GPL version 2 or later.  In other
words, I take no responsibility for this program, and you are free to
do anything you like with the source, provided the source is available
to anyone who asks for it.
