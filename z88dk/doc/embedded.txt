The embedded target (+embedded) has been supplied by Daniel Wallner and targets
his Z80 core http://www.opencores.org/projects/t80/.

"Console" Input and output is provided by a 16450 UART. 

It is important to initialise the UART at the start of your program, eg:

#include <stdio.h>
#include "ns16450.h"

int main()
{
	init_uart(0,1);
	printf("Hello world!");
}

Floating point is supported by this port, and some example are given in
examples/embedded (NB. Many of these examples could be made to work
on other z88dk targets with the minimum of hassle)
