;       Kludgey startup for nc100

; 	I've never used one of these brutes so I dunno if it's
;	correct at all, this is all taken from the file nciospec.doc
;	on nvg.unit.no, I assume that the PCMCIA RAM card is an
;	actual fact addressable RAM and we can overwrite variables
;	etc NB. Values of static variables are not reinitialised on
;	future entry.
