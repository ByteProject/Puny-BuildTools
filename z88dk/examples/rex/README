A bit of mystery.. I don't know whether this will work at all, but here's
a simple Rex 6000 example..

compile: zcc +rex -o hello.bin hello.c

If you have compiled mkaddin (from support/) then you can create an
addin in one go using:

zcc +rex -create-app -o hello.bin hello.c

(hello.bin is an intermediate binary file)

This uses the file hello.res which contains the application name, coment
and an icon in an obvious format

If hello.res doesn't exist then the defaults are used
