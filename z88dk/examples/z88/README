This directory contains examples which run from BASIC, compile them 
thus:

zcc -lm -lgfx cube.c		Generic Maths
zcc -lmz -lgfx cube.c		Z88 Maths
zcc -lgfx dstar.c
zcc -lgfx gfx.c
zcc rpn.c
zcc sorter.c
zcc enigma.c

The other examples aren't meant to be compiled, but just brief demonstrations

Or alternatively...use the makefile!
