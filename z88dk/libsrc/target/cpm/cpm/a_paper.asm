;
;		WARNING:
;		This function does not work under PCW or +3 CP/M (and probably not CPC CP/M either),
;		because the values in B and C are always reset to zero before they are examined.
;		To correct this bug, replace the byte sequence 3D 28 F0 3C 28 E6 with 00 00 00 00 00 00.
;		In a running system this is in bank 0, two bytes after the address in 00CCh.
