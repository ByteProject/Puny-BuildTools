This directory contains the start of some +3 support

The plan for spectrum disc systems is to have a different
library for each - this library contains the core routines:

spec_clib.lib then calls these routines

This seems to be the easiest way of making things work on
different machines easily...

This library doesn't contain file positioning etc routines
