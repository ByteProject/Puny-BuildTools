# ZX SPECTRUM TRITONE MUSIC DEMO

Tritone is a music engine that delivers three voices and drum effects through the Spectrum's 1-bit beeper.  Composing can be done with the PC tool "Beepola".

This example demonstrates a few things like how to play tritone music, data compression and simple keyboard input through stdio.

Many thanks to [Frank Triggs](http://tinyurl.com/mefafxa) for allowing us to use his excellent music in this demo.
