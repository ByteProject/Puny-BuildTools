COREMARK 1.0
============

http://www.eembc.org/coremark/download.php

Coremark is a modern replacement of dhrystone and whetstone to
test performance of embedded cpus.

Coremark's license prevents public distribution of the source
code, although they will allow anyone to download it from their
website after registration and agreeing to licensing terms.

Those terms prevent the source code from being replicated here
but we will do our best to describe any necessary changes
required to compile with the various compilers tested here.
