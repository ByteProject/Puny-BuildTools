# ULA+

ULA+ is a hardware modification for the zx spectrum that has been adopted by a number of recent hardware projects including a replacement ULA for the original hardware and the newly crowdfunded ZX Next.

It acts as a 64-colour GRB332 palette that assigns colours to attribute values normally fetched from the zx spectrum's display memory.  As such it does not address colour clash but does improve on available colours.  On machines related to the spectrum with higher colour resolution, such as the timex machines, ULA+ can make a substantial difference in the quality of photo-realistic scenes.
