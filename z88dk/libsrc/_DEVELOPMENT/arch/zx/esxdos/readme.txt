Information about programming esxdos is scarce.

The information here comes from various sources but principally
from a conversation with Miguel some time ago.

In that conversation he asked that I do not release this information
publicly because it was subject to change.  He didn't want people
making widespread use of it, which would mean his design would be
locked in for the sake of backwards compatibility.

Obviously this is somewhat public and you've found this information.
Please continue to honour his request and write your software so that
it is prepared for potentially incompatible changes to come.
