DesktopFontEditorFZX
====================

This package contains all 15 large (although incomplete) fonts extracted from 
the Font Editor program distributed with Proxima Software's "Desktop" utility,
now converted to the "FZX" standard format.

Since "Desktop" is currently released as "public domain", the same distribution
also applies to these converted fonts.
