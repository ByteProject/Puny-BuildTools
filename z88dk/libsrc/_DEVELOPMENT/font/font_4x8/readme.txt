FONT_4X8
========

This directory contains a collection of 4x8 fonts.

Character definitions begin with ascii code 32 with each
character occupying eight bytes.  Each row of a four
pixel wide character is stored in a single byte with
the first four bits repeated in the second four bits.
This speeds up printing on some targets.
