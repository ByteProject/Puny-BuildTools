FONT/FZX
========

A monochrome proportional font engine originally designed for the
Sinclair ZX Spectrum by Andrew Owen and implemented by Einar Saukas.
Close to 100 fonts are available, along with a PC tool for designing
them.

The z88dk implementation has been augmented with functions to report
widths of strings in pixels and character metrics.
