; Initially called once the required operand pointers and commands are loaded
; Following calls generated by END signal whenever a single APU command is completed
; Sends a new command (with operands if needed) to the APU
;
; On interrupt exit APUStatus contains either
; __IO_APU_STATUS_BUSY = 1, and rest of APUStatus bits are invalid
; __IO_APU_STATUS_BUSY = 0, idle, and the status bits resulting from the final COMMAND
