All routines in this directory are machine independent!

There are two entry points for each function: the usual CALLER linkage
with a call to name() and the CALLEE linkage name_callee().  The latter
is much better and macros defined in the header file ensure that callee
linkage is used by default.  The CALLER linkage functions are there
for function pointers.
