Examples 4a and 4b concern the idea of iterating over
the individual sprite characters making up each sprite.
The spectrum version of these examples uses this to
individually colour each sprite character.  However
as the hi-res mode doesn't have colour the example does not
translate.  I still encourage you to at least read the
comments and source code in the spectrum version of these
examples to understand the concept of sprite character
iteration.  This will help in understanding the sp1
library as a whole.  The example series may come back
to this concept when some more advanced ideas have
been explored.

All sp1 ports support sprite character iteration using
sp1_IterateSprChar() it's just at this point we can't
make a relevant example of its use in a b&w mode.
