ZX ROM based math library - Stefano Bodrato - 24/3/2003

This library is much smaller than the default one but it is slower, less precise and slightly less complete.



The "TINYMODE" flag cuts away the long integers handling and the precision parameter handling of the atof function (BTW leading zeroes are not displayed also with the full version).
