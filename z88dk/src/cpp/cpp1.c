 * CPP main program.

 *
 *
 * Edit history
 * 21-May-84	MM	"Field test" release
 * 23-May-84	MM	Some minor hacks.
 * 30-May-84	ARF	Didn't get enough memory for __DATE__
 *			Added code to read stdin if no input
 *			files are provided.
 * 29-Jun-84	MM	Added ARF's suggestions, Unixifying cpp.
 * 11-Jul-84	MM	"Official" first release (that's what I thought!)
 * 22-Jul-84	MM/ARF/SCK Fixed line number bugs, added cpp recognition
 *			of #line, fixed problems with #include.
 * 23-Jul-84	MM	More (minor) include hacking, some documentation.
 *			Also, redid cpp's #include files
 * 25-Jul-84	MM	#line filename isn't used for #include searchlist
 *			#line format is <number> <optional name>
 * 25-Jul-84	ARF/MM	Various bugs, mostly serious.  Removed homemade doprint
 * 01-Aug-84	MM	Fixed recursion bug, remove extra newlines and
 *			leading whitespace from cpp output.
 * 02-Aug-84	MM	Hacked (i.e. optimized) out blank lines and unneeded
 *			whitespace in general.  Cleaned up unget()'s.
 * 03-Aug-84	Keie	Several bug fixes from Ed Keizer, Vrije Universitet.
 *			-- corrected arg. count in -D and pre-defined
 *			macros.  Also, allow \n inside macro actual parameter
 *			lists.
 * 06-Aug-84	MM	If debugging, dump the preset vector at startup.
 * 12-Aug-84	MM/SCK	Some small changes from Sam Kendall
 * 15-Aug-84	Keie/MM	cerror, cwarn, etc. take a single string arg.
 *			cierror, etc. take a single int. arg.
 *			changed LINE_PREFIX slightly so it can be
 *			changed in the makefile.
 * 31-Aug-84	MM	USENET net.sources release.
 *  7-Sep-84	SCH/ado Lint complaints
 * 10-Sep-84	Keie	Char's can't be signed in some implementations
 * 11-Sep-84	ado	Added -C flag, pathological line number fix
 * 13-Sep-84	ado	Added -E flag (does nothing) and "-" file for stdin.
 * 14-Sep-84	MM	Allow # 123 as a synonym for #line 123
 * 19-Sep-84	MM	scanid always reads to token, make sure #line is
 *			written to a new line, even if -C switch given.
 *			Also, cpp - - reads stdin, writes stdout.
 * 03-Oct-84	ado/MM	Several changes to line counting and keepcomments
 *			stuff.  Also a rewritten control() hasher -- much
 *			simpler and no less "perfect". Note also changes
 *			in cpp3.c to fix numeric scanning.
 * 04-Oct-84	MM	Added recognition of macro formal parameters if
 *			they are the only thing in a string, per the
 *			draft standard.
 * 08-Oct-84	MM	One more attack on scannumber
 * 15-Oct-84	MM/ado	Added -N to disable predefined symbols.  Fixed
 *			linecount if COMMENT_INVISIBLE enabled.
 * 22-Oct-84	MM	Don't evaluate the #if/#ifdef argument if
 *			compilation is supressed.  This prevents
 *			unnecessary error messages in sequences such as
 *			    #ifdef FOO		-- undefined
 *			    #if FOO == 10	-- shouldn't print warning
 * 25-Oct-84	MM	Fixed bug in false ifdef supression.  On vms,
 *			#include <foo> should open foo.h -- this duplicates
 *			the behavior of Vax-C
 * 31-Oct-84	ado/MM	Parametized $ in indentifiers.  Added a better
 *			token concatenator and took out the trial
 *			concatenation code.  Also improved #ifdef code
 *			and cleaned up the macro recursion tester.
 *  2-Nov-84	MM/ado	Some bug fixes in token concatenation, also
 *			a variety of minor (uninteresting) hacks.
 *  6-Nov-84	MM	Happy Birthday.  Broke into 4 files and added
 *			#if sizeof (basic_types)
 *  9-Nov-84	MM	Added -S* for pointer type sizes
 * 13-Nov-84	MM	Split cpp1.c, added vms defaulting
 * 23-Nov-84	MM/ado	-E supresses error exit, added CPP_INCLUDE,
 *			fixed strncpy bug.
 *  3-Dec-84	ado/MM	Added OLD_PREPROCESSOR
 *  7-Dec-84	MM	Stuff in Nov 12 Draft Standard
 * 17-Dec-84	george	Fixed problems with recursive macros
 * 17-Dec-84	MM	Yet another attack on #if's (f/t)level removed.
 * 07-Jan-85	ado	Init defines before doing command line options
 *			so -Uunix works.
 * 11-Feb-94    MH      Changed token concatenation (hopefully) to ANSI 
 *                      standard and added token quoting.
 * 26-Nov-94    MH      -P problem of outputting a newline after leading
 *                      white space in order to correct counter if fixed 
 *                      now.  Several other fixes for -P, too.
