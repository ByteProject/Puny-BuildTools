## Instructions

Windows and MacOSX users can get zsdcc and zsdcpp binaries from the [nightly build](http://nightly.z88dk.org/).

To build from source apply the patch in this directory to sdcc r11535 v4.0.0.
Compile instructions can be found [here](https://www.z88dk.org/wiki/doku.php?id=temp:front#sdcc1).

For an error-free compile you may want to limit the target cpus in the build to just the z80 family (z80/z180/rabbits).  [z88dk.Dockerfile](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/z88dk.Dockerfile)
can provide such hints for compiling the zsdcc source. A configuration command provided for example.

```bash
./configure --disable-ds390-port --disable-ds400-port --disable-hc08-port --disable-s08-port --disable-mcs51-port --disable-pic-port --disable-pic14-port --disable-pic16-port --disable-tlcs90-port --disable-xa51-port --disable-stm8-port --disable-pdk13-port --disable-pdk14-port --disable-pdk15-port --disable-pdk16-port --disable-ucsim --disable-device-lib --disable-packihx
```
An alternative course is to use [docker](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/Dockerfile.md)
to install z88dk.

### Patch Information

`sdcc-z88dk.patch` is the current default standard patch.

`sdcc-11535-z88dk.patch` is the current zsdcc patch, retained for comparison and building against sdcc r11535.

`sdcc-9958-z88dk.patch` is the previous zsdcc standard patch, retained for comparison and building against sdcc r9958.

`sdcc-10892-z88dk-peep.patch` has been submitted as sdcc [feature request # 289](https://sourceforge.net/p/sdcc/patches/289/) for review, test, and integrate from that end. This file is retained for the record. z88dk does not normally use the sdcc peephole optimiser, so these patches remain optional.

Essentially, the patch items remaining are just those things which are zsdcc specific, which don't make sense to push into sdcc.
