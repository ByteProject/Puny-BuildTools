 * of the C99 standard (and especially the C preprocessor) told me that
 * it was unclear whether _Pragma() are evaluated inside directives such
 * as #if, #include and #line. If you want to disable the evaluation of
 * _Pragma() inside such directives, define the following macro.
 */
/* #define NO_PRAGMA_IN_DIRECTIVE */

/*
 * The C99 standard mandates that the operator `##' must yield a single,
 * valid token, lest undefined behaviour befall upon thy head. Hence,
 * for instance, `+ ## +=' is forbidden, because `++=' is not a valid
 * token (although it is a valid list of two tokens, `++' and `=').
 * However, ucpp only emits a warning for such sin, and unmerges the
 * tokens (thus emitting `+' then `+=' for that example). When ucpp
 * produces text output, those two tokens will be separated by a space
 * character so that the basic rule of text output is preserved: when
 * parsed again, text output yields the exact same stream of tokens.
 * That extra space is virtual: it does not count as a true whitespace
 * token for stringization.
 *
 * However, it might be desirable, for some uses other than preprocessing
 * C source code, not to emit that extra space at all. To make ucpp behave
 * that way, define the DSHARP_TOKEN_MERGE macro. Please note that this
 * can trigger spurious token merging. For instance, with that macro
 * activated, `+ ## +=' will be output as `++=' which, if preprocessed
 * again, will read as `++' followed by `='.
 *
 * All this is irrelevant to lexer mode; and trying to merge incompatible
 * tokens is a shooting offence, anyway.

 * Arithmetic code for evaluation of #if expressions. Evaluation
 * uses either a native machine type, or an emulated two's complement
 * type. Division by 0 and overflow on division are considered as errors
 * and reported as such. If ARITHMETIC_CHECKS is defined, all other
 * operations that imply undefined or implementation-defined behaviour
 * are reported as warnings but otherwise performed nonetheless.
 *
 * For native type evaluation, the following macros should be defined:
 *   NATIVE_SIGNED           the native signed type
 *   NATIVE_UNSIGNED         the native corresponding unsigned type
 *   NATIVE_UNSIGNED_BITS    the native unsigned type width, in bits
 *   NATIVE_SIGNED_MIN       the native signed type minimum value
 *   NATIVE_SIGNED_MAX       the native signed type maximum value
 *
 * The code in the arith.c file performs some tricky detection
 * operations on the native type representation and possible existence
 * of a trap representation. These operations assume a C99-compliant
 * compiler; on a C90-only compiler, the operations are valid but may
 * yield incorrect results. You may force those settings with some
 * more macros: see the comments in arith.c (look for "ARCH_DEFINED").
 * Remember that this is mostly a non-issue, unless you are building
 * ucpp with a pre-C99 cross-compiler and either the host or target
 * architecture uses a non-two's complement representation of signed
 * integers. Such a combination is pretty rare nowadays, so the best
 * you can do is forgetting completely this paragraph and live in peace.
 *
 *
 * If you do not have a handy native type (for instance, you compile ucpp
 * with a C90 compiler which lacks the "long long" type, or you compile
 * ucpp for a cross-compiler which should support an evaluation integer
 * type of a size that is not available on the host machine), you may use
 * a simulated type. The type uses two's complement representation and
 * may have any width from 2 bits to twice the underlying native type
 * width, inclusive (odd widths are allowed). To use an emulated type,
 * make sure that NATIVE_SIGNED is not defined, and define the following
 * macros:
 *   SIMUL_ARITH_SUBTYPE     the native underlying type to use
 *   SIMUL_SUBTYPE_BITS      the native underlying type width
 *   SIMUL_NUMBITS           the emulated type width
 *
 * Undefined and implementation-defined behaviours are warned upon, if
 * ARITHMETIC_CHECKS is defined. Results are truncated to the type
 * width; shift count for the << and >> operators is reduced modulo the
 * emulatd type width; right shifting of a signed negative value performs
 * sign extension (the result is left-padded with bits set to 1).
