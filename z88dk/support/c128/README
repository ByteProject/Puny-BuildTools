VICE emulator required.

RUN x128 and create a blank disk image (mydisk.d64),
then exit emulator and do the following steps:

zcc +c128ansi program.c	-> compile the program
bin3000 a.bin z80mc	-> add the 2 bit address stub
c1541 mydisk.d64
	(write z80run)	-> insert the BASIC loader (if new disk)
	(delete z80mc)	-> delete the old MC program (if any)
	write z80mc	-> insert the (new) MC program
	exit

x128 mydisk.d64	-> run the emulator
	load "z80run",8	-> load the BASIC loader
	run

The code is put at the address $3000; to modify at least the 
ORG address in c128_crt0.asm and the line 12 of the BASIC loader
need to be changed (BLOAD "z80mc",b0,P[location]).


Have fun!
