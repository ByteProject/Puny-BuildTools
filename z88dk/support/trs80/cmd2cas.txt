CMD2CAS 1.0 (C) 2005 by Attila Grosz

This program converts standard TRS-80/System-80 disk
(CMD) files to tape (CAS) images.

Usage:

cmd2cas <cmd file> <cas file>

At the moment there are no command line options available.
Also, for now there are only two CMD block types supported: 
type 1 and 2. The program should work for most CMD files
nevertheless.

The resulting CAS image is a system image, you have to load
it by typing the command SYSTEM followed by the name of the 
program in the CAS image (this is the first 6 letters of the
filename). When the prompt is back, you should type / (slash)
to start the program as CAS files never autostart by 
themselves.
