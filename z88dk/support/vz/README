The default startup behaviour has now changed.
The BASIC loader block is embedded in the CRT0 stub, so that the resulting binary
file is ready for use (name it with the "vz" extension).
The graph/text mode is automatically switched by calling "clg" or printing CHR$ 12.

If you prefer the old behaviuour (separate BASIC loader + external tools), then 
go on reading.  This can still be useful for some particular situation, such as 
mixing BASIC and machine code.


THIS IS THE OLD PROCEDURE  (use the "-startup=2" parameter)

How pass the code to the VZ emulator.

- Get the VZ emulator from:
  http://www.powerup.com.au/~intertek/VZ200/vz.htm
- Get the utilities, also
- Set the environment variables correctly
- Compile your code (to a.bin)  NOTE: the "-startup=2" parameter is now required
- Use the rbinary utility (Rbinary.exe a.bin a.vz)
- Run the emulator
- Type: POKE 30862,0:POKE 30863,128
- Press F10, then 1 (Load Program)
- Chose a.vz
- Return to the emulator (press ENTER)
- Type: X=USR(0)

Enjoy it !

The most difficult thing is to "understand" the VZ keyboard;
only the left SHIFT key works.
It is also possible to create a .WAV file for passing the program on tape.

If you're going to run graphics type in a small BASIC program like this:
10 MODE (1)
20 X = USR (0)

After executing the program BASIC goes back to text mode.
