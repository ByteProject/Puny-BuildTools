This tool was originally written in BDS C by Richard Greenlaw and then ported
to different C flavours during the years.  The last version by Theo Perry was
quite modern but not enough to be easily compiled with the latest gcc versions.
It is based on a Huffman coding scheme but fast enough to be run on old CPUs.
This is yet another update, able to build with z88dk and gcc.

It should run on any z88dk target with a full fcntl implementation and 16K RAM.
An OS shell is useful but not strictly needed, in case no parameters are given,
the program will run in interactive mode prompting the user for the single file
names.

It can just be used locally on the target computer or to prepare files to be 
transferred from a modern computer to it (in case of low transfer speed).
Also, it can be a good way to recover programs coming from old CP/M archives.
Typical file extensions which might be found online are ".CQ" or ".AQM", they
will be converted to C and ASM (or AZM) source files.

Misc examples in command line mode (Wildcards are valid only with OSCA FLOS and UNIX):

SQ *.TXT
USQ *.?Q?
SQ README.TXT *.EXE
USQ -20 README.TQT   - (type the first 20 lines on screen)
USQ -P300 README.TQT - (interactively read 300 rows of text, paged every 23 lines)
USQ -F200 *.TQT      -  print on screen, insert a form feed at the end of every file, 
                        not of much use when redirection/echo on printer is not supported.. 
 
SQ or USq without parameters -> enter in interactive mode, almost useless on CP/M and OSCA FLOS,
but essential for those systems without an OS or systems taking long time to load the command.

NAME
       sq, usq - squeeze (compress) files

SYNOPSYS
       sq [ file1 ] [ file2 ] ...   usq [ -count ] [ [ -fcount ] [ -pcount ] ]
       [file1 ] [ file2 ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       sq compresses one or more files, using a Huffman  coding  scheme.   usq
       decompresses  or  displays one or more files squeezed by sq.  The algo‚Äê
       rithm is identical to the one used by the popular  public  domain  'SQ'
       programs, originally authored by Richard Greenlaw.

       sq  will squeeze each file passed on the argument line.  It will append
       `.SQ' to the original file name to create the output file name.  If  no
       file  names  are given, sq will prompt for file names from the standard
       input.  A message is printed for each file, tracing each  pass  of  the
       compression process.

       usq  will unsqueeze or display the files requested on the command line.
       If no files are requested,  the file names are input from the  standard
       input.   If  no option is given, the file is unsqueezed to its original
       name.

       If the -count option is used, count lines are displayed from the  start
       of the file, with all unprintable characters except CR, LF, TAB, and FF
       converted to periods.  The output is sent to the standard  output.   If
       the  -fcount  option  is  used,  the  file is displayed with a formfeed
       appended to the preview of each file.  If the -pcount option  is  used,
       the user is prompted for a keypress every 23 lines.

BUGS
       The  file  naming  convention  is not a one-to-one mapping, so multiple
       files may be squeezed to the same output file name.  Also,  the  output
       file name for usq cannot be overridden.
