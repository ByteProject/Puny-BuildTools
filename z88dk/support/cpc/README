Amstrad CPC
(see also the notes on "z88dk/doc/cpc.txt")

- Compile the program (optionally you can set another address for ORG)
	zcc +cpc program.c
- Prepare an empty snapshot with your preferred Amstrad emulator
  (the snapshot format may be a bit different, but normally the locations
   are the same)
	memory &1fff  (BASIC command)
- Save the snapshot and exit from the emulator
- Insert the compiled code into the snapshot:
	sna_mng i a.bin loader.sna 24576 30000
- Re-run the emulator, load the modified snapshot and type:
	call &6000

As an alternative the XTI (Disk Image XTender) utility can be used; 
this puts a binary file into a disk image.
A valid location/version for XTI (when this document is been updated) is:
ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/amstrad/emu-uti/pcxti14.zip


Enjoy !
