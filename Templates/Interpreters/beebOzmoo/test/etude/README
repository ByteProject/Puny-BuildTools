This archive contains the TerpEtude game file (etude.z5). 

It also contains all the Inform 6 source code for TerpEtude:

etude.inf
accents.inc
accentin.inc
color.inc
division.inc
exittext.inc
givenin.inc
graham.inf
header.inc
styles.inc
timedch.inc
timedstr.inc
undo.inc

I strongly recommend that TerpEtude only be distributed in this
format -- that is, with game file and source code together. A
programmer who wants to test his interpreter can't really know
what he's doing unless he sees exactly what the tests are.

I've also thrown in gntests.z5 and gntests.inf; this program
comprises the six test programs that Graham appended to the
Z-Spec TeX document. (Taken from the 0.99 spec.tex file.)
