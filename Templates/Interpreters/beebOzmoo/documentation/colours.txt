Colours in Z-code games
-----------------------
Ozmoo lets you pick two different colour schemes for your game. We refer to these to colour schemes as normal mode and darkmode. The idea is that you may want lighter text on a dark background when playing at night, while dark text on a light background has proven to be easier to read, when reading large amounts of text. Ozmoo will always start in normal mode, and the player can switch between normal mode and darkmode using the F1 key. When switching modes, Ozmoo will change the colour of all onscreen text which has the default foreground colour *or* which has the same colour as the background colour in the mode it's switching to and thus would otherwise become invisible.


make.rb has the following switches to control colours:

-rc:(Z-code colour)=(C64 colour), ...
	Replace colours: Replaces one or more colours in the Z-code palette with the specified colours in the C64 palette.

-dc:(Default background colour):(Default foreground colour)
	Default colours: This picks the Z-code colours to use as default background and foreground colours.

-sc:(Statusline colour)
	Statusline colour: This picks the Z-code colour to use as statusline colour. This is only possible with version 3 story files (z3).

-bc:(Border colour)
	Border colour. This picks the Z-code colour to use as border colour. 
	Special values: 0 = same as background colour (default), 1 = same as foreground colour. If the game itself changes the screen colours,
	as it may do in Z5+ games, values 0 and 1 mean the border changes too.

-dmdc: (same as -dc but for darkmode)

-dmsc: (same as -sc but for darkmode)

-dmbc: (same as -bc but for darkmode)

The color (and shape) of the cursor can also be customized:

-cb:(delay)
	Cursor blinking frequency. delay is 0 to 9, where 9 is fastest.

-cc:(Cursor color)
	Cursor colour: This picks the Z-code colour for the cursor shown when waiting for player input. 

-dmcc: (same as -dc but for darkmode)

-cs:(Cursor shape)
    Cursor shape: either of b,u or l; where b=block (default) shape, u=underscore shape and l=line shape.


Z-code has a palette of 8 colours, numbered 2-9:

  2 = black       
  3 = red         
  4 = green       
  5 = yellow      
  6 = blue        
  7 = magenta     
  8 = cyan        
  9 = white       

The Commodore 64 has 16 colours, numbered 0-15:

  0 = black
  1 = white
  2 = red
  3 = cyan
  4 = purple
  5 = green
  6 = blue
  7 = yellow
  8 = orange
  9 = brown
 10 = pink
 11 = dark grey
 12 = grey
 13 = light green
 14 = light blue
 15 = light grey

Examples
--------

Use cyan text on black background with a yellow statusbar (only works for z3!):

make.rb -dc:2:8 -sc:5 game.z3


Change so Z-code color 7 is dark grey instead of magenta and Z-code color 8 is light grey instead of cyan, and use these as default colors:

make.rb -rc:7=11,8=15 -dc:7:8 game.z5


Setting up the default palette (even though this isn't useful) is equivalent to using:

make.rb -rc:2=0,3=2,4=5,5=7,6=6,7=4,8=3,9=1 game.z5
