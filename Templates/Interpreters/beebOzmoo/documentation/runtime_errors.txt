ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_STREAM = 1

The Z-machine supports certain streams for input and output of text. If a program tries to open a stream number which is not defined or which is not supported by Ozmoo, this error occurs.

ERROR_CONFIG = 2

The boot disk of a program built with Ozmoo has config information on sector 1:0 and 1:1 (unless it's built as a single file program). This error means there seems to be something wrong with this information. The information is copied to memory when the game boots and then used whenever a block of game data needs to be copied from disk, so the problems may be discovered when the boot disk is no longer in the drive.

ERROR_STREAM_NESTING_ERROR = 3

The Z-machine has a stack for memory streams. If the program tries to pull items from this stack when it is empty, this is the resulting error.

ERROR_FLOPPY_READ_ERROR = 4

There was a problem reading from the disk.

ERROR_STACK_FULL = 6

The program tried to make a routine call or push data onto the stack when there was not enough room. This means there is a bug in the program, or it needs a bigger stack. Stack size can be set with a commandline parameter to make.rb.

ERROR_STACK_EMPTY = 7

The program tried to pull a value from the stack when it was empty.

ERROR_OPCODE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED = 8

An unknown Z-machine opcode was encountered. This can happen if the wrong disk is in the drive when Ozmoo tries to retrieve a block of program code.

ERROR_USED_NONEXISTENT_LOCAL_VAR = 9

Each routine in Z-code has between 0 and 15 local variables. If an instruction references a local variable number which is not present in this routine, this is what happens. Normally, a compiler like Inform doesn't let the programmer write code which can cause this, unless you skip the highlevel language and write Z-machine assembler. 

ERROR_BAD_PROPERTY_LENGTH = 10

The program tried to use an object property of an illegal length, where a property value has to be one or two bytes.

ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_STORY_VERSION = 11

The first byte of the story file must match the Z-machine version for which the interpreter was built (3, 4, 5 or 8). Otherwise, this occurs.

ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY = 12

The program referenced memory which is higher than the last address in the story file.

ERROR_WRITE_ABOVE_DYNMEM = 13

The program tried to write to memory which is not part of dynamic (RAM) memory.

ERROR_TOO_MANY_TERMINATORS = 15

A dictionary in a Z-machine program holds a list of terminating characters, which are used to separate words. It is illegal for this list to hold more than ten characters. If it does, this error occurs.

ERROR_NO_VMEM_INDEX = 16

The vmem_oldest_index is only populated inside the loop if we find a non-PC vmem block older than the initial vmem_oldest_age of $ff. That should always happen, but to assert that the code is correct the debug version of Ozmoo checks that vmem_oldest_index is valid and issues ERROR_NO_VMEM_INDEX if not.

ERROR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO = 17

An attempt was made to divide a number by zero.
