Targets
-------

While the main target for Ozmoo is the Commodore 64, it is possible to target
other similar computers. make.rb takes a -t:target argument to enable such
future extensions, but currently only c64 is supported, and the rest of this
documents is c64 specific.


Drives and devices
------------------
A game built using Ozmoo is placed on one or more disks. These disks can then be used in different disk drive devices attached to the C64. The device numbers which can be used are 8, 9, 10, 11. Two different story disks can not use the same device number.


Build modes
-----------

Notes: 

* Preloading means some or all of memory is filled with suitable parts of the story file, by loading this content from a file as the game starts. Using preloading speeds up game start for many players since this initial loading sequence can use any fastloader the user may have enabled. It also means gameplay is as fast as it gets, right from the start.

* Less RAM available for virtual memory system: This means a smaller part of C64 memory can be used for virtual memory handling, which means the game will need to load sectors from disk more often. This will of course slow the game down.

Modes not requiring a disk drive for play:
---
P: Program file
	Story file size < ~51 KB: Using full amount of RAM.
	Story file size < ~40 KB: You may use flag -r to only use RAM up to $CFFF. This means all RAM can be accessed directly without buffers, which makes the interpreter smaller and the game faster.

	Disks used:
		* Boot / Story disk. This contains a single file, which may be moved to any other medium, like another disk image or a tape image.


Modes requiring a single 1541 drive for play:
---
S1: Single 1541 drive, one disk
	Story file size < ~140 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~180 KB: Less preloading the larger the story file. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.

	Disks used:
		* Boot / Story disk
	
S2: Single 1541 drive, two disks
	Story file size < ~210 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~230 KB: Full preloading. Less RAM available for virtual memory system the larger the story file.

	Disks used:
		* Boot disk
		* Story disk
	
Modes requiring two 1541 drives for play:
---
D2: Double 1541 drives, two disks
	Story file size < ~330 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~370 KB: Less preloading the larger the story file. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.

	Disks used:
		* Boot disk / Story disk A
		* Story disk B

D3: Double 1541 drives, three disks
	Story file size < ~400 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~420 KB: Full preloading. Less RAM available for virtual memory system the larger the story file.

	Disks used:
		* Boot disk
		* Story disk A
		* Story disk B

Modes requiring a 1581 drive for play:
---
81: Single 1581 drive, one disk
	Any story size: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	
	Thanks to the partitioning available on the 1581, the story data is protected even in the event of a validate command. Thus, the user can safely use the story disk as a save disk as well.

	Disks used:
		* Boot / Story disk

Modes requiring a 1571 or an SD2IEC:
---
To be added at a later date. A single drive 1571 mode could be used for story files up to about 360 KB in size. SD2IEC mode could enable full 512 KB story sizes.
