Interpreter config
------------------
Interpreter configuration is stored in two blocks on the boot disk (track 19, sector 0-1). The interpreter loads this information when it starts.

Contents:
4 bytes: Game signature: A 32-bit random number.

--- Disk information block ---
1 byte: Number of bytes used for disk information, including this byte
1 byte: Interleave (in range 1-21)
1 byte: Number of save slots which can fit on a disk (in range 4-132)
1 byte: Number of disks used (disk 0 is the save disk(s), disk 1 .. are game disks
For each disk:
		1 byte: n: Number of bytes used for this entry, including this byte.
		1 byte: Device#. Should be 8,9,10,11 or 0, meaning it's not decided yet - it's up to the terp to set the device#.
		2 bytes: Last story block # + 1 (high endian) on this disk 
		1 byte: t: Number of tracks used for story data (If this number is > 0, this is a story disk!)
		t bytes: Sectors used for story data: Bit 0-4: # of sectors used. Bit 5-7: First sector# used. (Example: %01010000: Use 16 sectors, starting with #2)
		x bytes: Disk name in Petscii. Special codes:
			0: End of string
			128: "Boot "
			129: "Story "
			130: "Save "
			131: "disk "

--- Vmem information block ---
1 byte: Number of bytes used for vmem information, including this byte
1 byte: Number of vmem blocks suggested for initial caching
1 byte: Number of vmem blocks already preloaded
x bytes: vmap_z_h contents for the suggested blocks
x bytes: vmap_z_l contents for the suggested blocks


Typical size for a 3-disk ( + save disk) game:

4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 40 + 5) + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 + 100 = 
8 + 2 * 50 + 2 * 8 + 203 = 
8 + 100 + 16 + 203 = 
327 bytes

An interpreter needs to reserve this space for disk information:
z3: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3) + (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 40 + 6) = 4 + 2 * 8 + 51 = 71 bytes
z4/z5/z8:  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3) + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 40 + 5) = 4 + 2 * 8 + 2 * 50 = 120 bytes

1581 drive support: This system should work, without extending the limits above, using only 31 sectors per track for story data, while allowing z8 games of up to 512 KB in size on a single disk. If we want to store several games on a single 1581 disk, we should add a track offset in each disk entry (i.e. saying that tracks below track x are considered empty).


Possible 1571 support:
	z3 games: No change
	z4/z5 games: A single disk using only track 1-53 can hold all story data. Disk information will then fit in less than the number of bytes stated above.
	z8 games: Disk information for a single drive game will fit in the number of bytes stated above. Double 1571 drive support is possible but not a high priority.
