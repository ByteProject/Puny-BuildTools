Flags which can be used to affect how the interpreter is built
----

The flags described here can be set on the Acme commandline using the syntax -D[flag]=1


General flags:

ALLRAM
	Utilize all available RAM for game data (Not setting it means RAM at $D000-$FFFF will not be used.)
BGCOL=n
	Set the background colour.
BORDERCOL=n
	Set the border colour.
CACHE_PAGES=n
	Set the minimum number of memory pages to use for the cache (used to buffer pages otherwise residing at $D000-$FFFF).
COL2=n
COL3=n
COL4=n
COL5=n
COL6=n
COL7=n
COL8=n
COL9=n
	Replace color in Z-machine palette with a certain colur from the C64 palette.
CUSTOM_FONT
	Tell the interpreter that a custom font will be used.
GERMAN_CHARS
	Map German characters in ZSCII to their PETSCII equivalents.
SMALLBLOCK
	When using virtual memory, use a blocksize of 512 bytes rather than 1024 bytes.
STACK_PAGES=n
	Set the number of memory pages to use for stack.
STATCOL=n
	Set the statusline colour. (only for z3).
SWEDISH_CHARS
	Map Swedish characters in ZSCII to their PETSCII equivalents.
VMEM
	Utilize virtual memory. Without this, the complete game must fit in C64 RAM available above the interpreter and below $D000, all in all about 40 KB. Also check section "Virtual memory flags" below. 
Z3
Z4
Z5
Z8
	Build the interpreter to run Z-machine version 3, 4, 5 or 8.


	
	
Debug flags 
---
(If any of the flags in this section are enabled, DEBUG is automatically enabled too.)
	
DEBUG
	Print debug information, print descriptive error messages, store a trace of the instructions which have been executed and print them in case of an exception. Also check section "Debug flags" below.
BENCHMARK
	When the game starts, replay a number of colon-separated commands which have been stored with the interpreter (in the file text.asm). Charcode 255 in this command sequence means print the number of jiffies since the computer was started.
COUNT_SWAPS
	Keep track of how many vmem block reads have been done.
PREOPT
	Built the interpreter in PREOPT mode (used to pick which virtual memory blocks should be preloaded into memory when the game starts).
PRINT_SWAPS
	Print information whenever a memory block is loaded into memory.
TRACE
	Print trace information.
TRACE_FLOPPY
	Print trace information for floppy operations.
TRACE_FLOPPY_VERBOSE
	Print verbose trace information for floppy operations.
TRACE_PRINT_ARRAYS
	?
TRACE_READTEXT
	Print trace information for opcode read/aread/sread.
TRACE_SHOW_DICT_ENTRIES
	?
TRACE_TOKENISE
	Print trace information for the tokenization process.
TRACE_VM
	Print trace information for the virtual memory system.
VICE_TRACE
	Send the last instructions executed to Vice, to aid in debugging.
VIEW_STACK_RECORDS
	Print whenever the stack size hits a new high, or when the number of bytes pushed onto the stack within a frame reaches a new high.
