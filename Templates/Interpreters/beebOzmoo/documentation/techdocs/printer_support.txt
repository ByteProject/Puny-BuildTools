Currently Ozmoo doesn't have any support for printers, but hooks
exist that could be used to add such functionality.

Infocom provided printer output through the transcript command, which
redirected text output to output stream 2. stream.asm implements
streaming, and stream_print_output can be extended to handle stream 2
and send the bytes to the printer.

We currently have no hardware to test printer support on, and no
immediate plans to provide such support. However, we are happy to
accept patches.
