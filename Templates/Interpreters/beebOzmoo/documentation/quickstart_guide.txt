To setup Ozmoo
---
1. Install Ruby, Vice, Exomizer and Acme (See readme file on how to get them).

2. Edit make.rb and change the values of $X64, $C1541, $EXOMIZER and $ACME at the beginning of the file, to point to their locations on your computer. If you are using Windows, you can ignore the section on Linux and vice versa.

To see all commandline options for make.rb

To build a game with optimized preloaded virtual memory data (will make the game as fast as possible in the beginning)
---
1. At a command prompt, type "ruby make.rb -o -s mygame.z5"

2. Play the game, performing the actions you think the player is likely to do first. Keep playing until the game halts, printing a report with lots of numbers. (You can also end it and get the report earlier by typing xxx)

3. In Vice, select Edit -> Copy from the menu

4. Create a text file (let's say you call it mygame_optimization.txt), paste the complete text you just copied from Vice into the file and save it.

5. At a command prompt, type "ruby make.rb -c mygame_optimization.txt mygame.z5"
