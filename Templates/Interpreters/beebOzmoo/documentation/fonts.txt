Fonts
-----

When building a game with make.rb, you can choose to embed a font (character set) with the game using the -f option. This will use up 2 KB of memory which would otherwise have been available for game data. The font file should be exactly 2048 bytes long and just hold the raw data for the font, without load address or other extra information.

Included with the Ozmoo distribution are these custom fonts:

* Clairsys.fnt: Clairsys, by Paul van der Laan.

You are free to use one of these fonts in a game you make and distribute, regardless of whether you make any money off of the game. You must however include credits for the font, stating the name of the font and the creator of the font. We strongly suggest you include these credits both in the docs / game distribution and somewhere within the game (Some games print "Type ABOUT for information about the game." or something to that effect as the game starts).

To see all the licensing details for each font, read the corresponding license file in the "fonts" folder. The full information in the license file must also be included with the game distribution if you embed a font with a game.
