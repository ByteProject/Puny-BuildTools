The game is compatible with the BBC Model B, BBC Model B+ and BBC Master 128 computers. It will run without sideways RAM, albeit slowly. Having at least 16K of sideways RAM or a 6502 second processor is recommended. Shadow RAM will make things even smoother. The game also runs on Acorn Electron computers, provided you have at least 16K of sideways RAM, which is a requirement. On the Elk, I recommend playing it with an ElkSD64, as with this device you won't need to worry about anything.
