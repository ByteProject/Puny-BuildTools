The Hibernated 1 source code is provided for personal, educational use only. You can read it, and copy the programming techniques, but you can't make derivative games.

External Content
Sources, binaries and disk templates included in this repository, which are not created by me (Stefan Vogt), retain their respective copyright and software license under which they were issued. Great care was taken that any external content in this collection of tools and resources may be freely distributable. A notable grey area are the few included Infocom interpreters. I am citing Andrew Plotkin and Jason Scott when I say that the historical value of these programs to the IF community outweighs the rights of the legal owner. Not to mention that no pecuniary loss occurs if a hobbyist IF author uses them to target an obsolete computer system, which is their only use. It should be noted that the bundled Infocom interpreters are clean versions with all game files and references completely removed, so all that remains is an obsolete program without context. 

If you are the copyright holder of a software found in the Puddle BuildTools distribution and you want me to exclude it, please get in touch with me.
